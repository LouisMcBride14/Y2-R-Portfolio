:::

Please ensure that the evidence covers all of the following learning objectives:

LO1: Can apply methods concerning estimation of parameters in standard statistical models; in particular the method of moments and the maximum likelihood method.

LO2: Can perform statistical hypotheses tests using data from studies (such as t and F-tests, comparison of models and parameter values).

LO3: Can apply methods for interval estimation; in particular, exact and approximate confidence intervals based on asymptotic theory.

LO4: Can apply methods for analysing categorical data.


## Evidence 1

Learning objective(s) assessed: **Please add here e.g. L01**

Please show any evidence for one (or more) of the learning objectives here. You may add R code as in the following.

```{r}
# Any R code here
```

**Any writing here**



## Evidence 2

Learning objective(s) assessed: **Please add here e.g. L01**

Please add new evidence and subsections as necessary.

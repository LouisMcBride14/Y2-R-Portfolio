LO1: Good so far, just repeat mle for different dist (exp, gamma??)

LO2: Nothing yet, use t / F-tests and compare models in another evidence

LO3: Decent so far, but use approximate confidence intervals based on asymptotic theory from Y2 (Chapter 19.1) 

LO4: Good so far, maybe do another in another evidence piece??

Overall: Make it easier to explain to stakeholder in the viva (less maths??)

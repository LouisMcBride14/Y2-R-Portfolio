LO1: Good so far, just repeat mle for different dist (exp, gamma??) [CHECK]

LO2: Nothing yet, use t / F-tests and compare models in evidence 3 [CHECK-ish (EVD2)]

LO3: Decent so far, but use approximate confidence intervals based on asymptotic theory from Y2 (Chapter 19.1) [CHECK]

LO4: Good so far, maybe do another in another evidence piece?? [EVD4??]

Overall: Make it easier to explain to stakeholder in the viva (less maths??)
